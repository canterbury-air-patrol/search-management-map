# Administration

Some basic management function of Search Management Map is provided by Django's built-in site administration system.

This is accessible as /admin/ on your server. If you have an instance running on your computer as per the basic [Installation](../Install/) instructions, this would be [http://localhost:8080/admin/](http://localhost:8080/admin/)
