# Assets
In Search Management Map, `Asset` is used as the general term for things that can perform a search. These could be aircraft, boats, off road vehicles, a search party, or anything else you have available to your organization(s).

If your user is the owner of an asset, you will be able to see it from the `Assets` link in the main menubar. From this list you will be able to access the per-asset [interface](/Assets/Interface.md)
