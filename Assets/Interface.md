# Interface
An interface is provided for assets to allow users to act on behalf of the asset.

You can access this interface by going to the `Assets` page and clicking on the `Interface` button next to the asset.

## Information
The first part of the page shows details about the asset.

## Mission Information
The next page of the page shows details related to the Current Mission (if this asset is assigned to a mission).

Additionally the current search, and the next queued search for this asset are shown.

## Current Command
The last command that was set for asset will be shown.
This will include the time the command was sent, what the command is, and a reason/note. Also, if the command is a goto instruction, it will include a position.

## Self Tracking
The asset interface can be used to record the position information for the asset.

This can be enabled by clicking the 'Enable' button. If this is working the current position of the device will be displayed and this will be sent to the server as the assets position.

This mechanism is intended to be used as a backup for assets that don't have another mechanism for sending their position to Search Management Map.

## Status
The asset interface can be used to update the status of the asset.

All of the possible status values are selectable in the drop-down and notes about the reason for the status change can be supplied in the notes box.
