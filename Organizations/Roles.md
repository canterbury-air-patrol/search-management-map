# Organization Roles
Roles in organizations give members access to different functionality related to the organization.

## Member
When users are first added they will be a `Member`. `Member`s role will give them access to any missions the organization has been added to.

## Admin
The user who creates an organization will be the `Admin`. `Admin`s can add and remove users from the organization. They can also perform any other action that another role can perform.

## Radio Operator
The `Radio Operator` role exists for users who communicate with assets that cannot access the map. They can accept and complete searches on behalf of assets in the organization.

## Asset Bridge/Recorder
The `Asset Bridge/Recorder` role exists for service accounts that integrate Search Management Map with external services. They can record the position of any asset in the organization. This is useful if you have another tracking service for your assets that you want to use to record their positions.
