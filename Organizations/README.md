# Organizations

Organizations are a way to to group users and assets. If an organization is added to a mission, then all members of that organization will have access to that mission. Also, organizations provide a way for users to act for assets that belong to other users.

How you break down organizations will depend on who has access to your instance. You should start with a single organization if your instance is just used by a single organization or team. Make sure to add all users to the organization.
